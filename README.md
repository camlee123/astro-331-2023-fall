# Astro 331X

In this class we will use Arduinos to build a satellite analog called FlatSAT to explore spacecraft design lessons. 

- FlatSAT is a mini version of the FalconSAT Avionics Test Bed (ATB)
- Arduino is a ubiquitous open source electronic prototyping ecosystem built around a series of microcontrollers



## Getting started

Before the first lab, open the `computer_environment` folder and follow the instructions in `README.md`. 

Instructions and code for each lab are located in the lab's numbered folder located in the `labs/` directory.
