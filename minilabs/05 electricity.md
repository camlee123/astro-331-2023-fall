# Familiarization Lab: Digital Logic and Breadboarding

In this familiarization lab you will create the digital logic circuit you developed during class. 



## Objective

- practice soldering
- determine current and voltage range of solar array



## soldering hardware

- bug kit
- solder
- sponge
- soldering iron
- stand



## solar array hardware

- solar array
- multimeter
- wires



## soldering

Wear safety glasses

Follow the instructions in your bug kit. 

Notes:

- iron will turn off automatically after ~10 min
- normal solder hardens to a shiny finish; this solder hardens to a matte finish
- you *should* clean the flux off of your part, but we donâ€™t have anything to clean it with
- do yourself a favor and discard this useless toy before you graduate



## solar array

With a multimeter, measure the short-circuit current ($I_{sc}$) and open-circuit voltage ($V_{oc}$) of your solar array when exposed to direct sunlight. Repeat with the array wired in series and in parallel. 



- record your solar array number: ___
- complete this table

|              | series | parallel |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- |
| current (mA) |        |          |
| voltage (V)  |        |          |



## Post-lab procedures

- Turn off soldering iron

- turn off multimeter

- clean up
